We build releases on the Contegix server.  

Due to space issues on that server, your M2_REPO cannot be located
under $HOME.  I currently uses /opt2/bob-maven-repo.  We should create
a build user with his own repo that we can share.

When building, skipping tests is fine, assuming your local and CI builds
both pass.

To do the test-build

	mvn -Pdist,local install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Verify it.

Then clean 

	mvn -Pdist,local clean

And rebuild as a deploy

	mvn -Pdist,local deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true

The "local" profile sets up the distribution repository as local to the
Contegix box, so it doesn't attempt to SSH things around, and instead
performs a local copy into the repository.
