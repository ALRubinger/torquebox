We build releases on the Contegix server as the 'torquebox-build' user.

	ssh torquebox-build@torquebox.org

Ensure you're using a JDK6:

	echo $JAVA_HOME
	which java
	java -version

When building, skipping tests is fine, assuming your local and CI builds
both pass.

To do the test-build

    $ rm -rf torquebox
    $ git clone git://github.com/torquebox/torquebox.git
    $ cd torquebox
    $ mvn -s build-support/settings.xml -Pdist,local install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Verify it.  If it looks good, then remove the SNAPSHOT suffix in all
the pom's, commit and push.

    $ perl -p -i -e 's/(.*)-SNAPSHOT/\1/' $(find . -name pom.xml)

Then back on the build box, check out the new version, build again and deploy

    $ rm -rf torquebox
    $ git clone git://github.com/torquebox/torquebox.git
    $ cd torquebox
    $ mvn -s build-support/settings.xml -Pdist,local install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    $ mvn -Pdist,local clean
    $ mvn -s build-support/settings.xml -Pdist,local deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true

The "local" profile sets up the distribution repository as local to the
Contegix box, so it doesn't attempt to SSH things around, and instead
performs a local copy into the repository.

Tag the release on github, e.g. 

    $ git tag 1.0.0.Beta22 f8268c1
    $ git push origin --tags

Manage versions in JIRA project administration.  Mark the version as released.

Update torquebox.org (git@github.com:torquebox/torquebox.org.git).
Verify your awestruct gem is current, and that you have the necessary
site-skin checked out.  See README.md.

    - Add the release to _config/releases.yml (scrape JIRA for jira_version)
    - Create a news item announcing the release with 'layout: release' header
    - Add the JIRA release notes to the announcement
    - Verify links on the /download page
    - Stage and deploy the docs per README.md

Use bit.ly to shorten the URL for the torquebox.org release announcement

    - Give it a custom URL like bit.ly/tb100b22

Let the world know

    - Tweet from @torquebox (password in oddthesis-private)
    - Announce on torquebox-dev@torquebox.org and torquebox-user@torquebox.org
    - Announce on thecore@redhat.com
