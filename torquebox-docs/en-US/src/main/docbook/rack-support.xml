    <title>Ruby-Rack</title>

    <para>Ruby-Rack is a generalized framework for interfacing web-servers
    with web frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails, Merb, or Sinatra. Internally
    TorqueBox uses Rack to integrate with Rails currently. Further exposure of
    Rack support for other frameworks, along with bare Rack capabilities
    (<filename>config.ru</filename>) is planned.</para>
