  <title>Rack Support</title>

  <section>
    <title>General <filename>config.ru</filename> Support</title>

    <para>TorqueBox current supports general
    <filename>config.ru</filename>-based applications. In your application's
    directory, your Rack application can be booted from a
    <filename>config.ru</filename> (or other filename) you provide. The Ruby
    runtime provided to your application is quite rudimentary. If you desire
    to use RubyGems or other libraries, it is up to you to require the
    necessary files (for instance, <code>require 'rubygems'</code>).</para>

    <para><screen>app = lambda{|env| 
        [ 200, 
          { 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/html' }, 
          'Hello World'
        ] 
      }
run app</screen></para>

  <section>
    <title>Rack deployment descriptor
    (<filename>*-rack.yml</filename>)</title>

    <para>To customize some of the aspects of deployment, instead of using the
    Rake tasks, you may manually create a <emphasis>deployment
    descriptor</emphasis>. A deployment descriptor is a small text file that
    is placed in the <filename>deploy/</filename> directory of the server in
    order to have the application deployed.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Location &amp; Naming</title>

      <para>The deployment descriptor needs to be placed within the deploy/
      directory of the AS configuration in use. If you are using the default
      configuration, the path would be:</para>

      <para><screen><filename>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/</filename></screen></para>

      <para>The descriptor is a YAML file, and must end with the suffix of
      <filename>-rack.yml</filename>. The prefix is arbitrary, but is usually
      some form of your application's name.</para>

      <para><screen><filename>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/<emphasis
              role="bold">myapp-rack.yml</emphasis></filename></screen></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Contents of the descriptor</title>

      <para>The descriptor has 2 main sections:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>General application configuration</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Web-specific configuration</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <section>
        <title>General Application Configuration</title>

        <para>The application section describes the <envar>RACK_ROOT</envar>
        and <envar>RACK_ENV</envar> for the deployed application. Under
        traditional (mongrel, lighttpd) deployments, this information is
        picked up through the current working directory or environment
        variables. Since the TorqueBox Server runs from a different location,
        the current working directory has no meaning. Likewise, as multiple
        applications may be deployed within a single TorqueBox Server, a
        single global environment variable to set <envar>$RACK_ENV</envar> is
        nonsensical.</para>

        <para><example>
            <title>Application configuration in *-rack.yml</title>

            <para><screen>application:
  RACK_ROOT: /path/to/myapp
  RACK_ENV:  development</screen></para>
          </example></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Web-specific configuration</title>

        <para>Traditional Rails applications are deployed individually,
        without respect to hostnames or context-path. Running under TorqueBox,
        you may host several apps under a single host, or multiple apps under
        different hostnames.</para>

        <para>Both the virtual-host and context-path configuration are nested
        under the <emphasis>web</emphasis> section.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Virtual Hosts</title>

          <para>Virtual hosts allow one application to respond to
          <emphasis>www.host-one.com</emphasis>, while another running within
          the same JBoss AS to respond to
          <emphasis>www.host-two.com</emphasis>. If no host is specified, then
          the application will respond to all requests directed at the
          TorqueBox Server.</para>

          <para><example>
              <title>Virtual host configuration in *-rack.yml</title>

              <para><screen>web:
  host: www.host-one.com</screen></para>
            </example></para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Context paths</title>

          <para>In addition to virtual hosts, applications within a single
          TorqueBox Server may be separated purely by a <emphasis>context
          path</emphasis>. For a given host, the context path is the prefix
          used to access the application. Traditional Rails apps respond from
          the top of a site. By using a context path, you can mount
          applications at a location under the root.</para>

          <para>For example, <emphasis
          role="bold">http://www.host-one.com/app-one/</emphasis> could point
          to one application, while <emphasis
          role="bold">http://www.host-one.com/app-two/</emphasis> could point
          to another separate application.</para>

          <para><example>
              <title>Context path configuration in *-rack.yml</title>

              <para><screen>web:
  context: /app-one</screen></para>
            </example></para>

          <para>The context path and virtual host configurations can be used
          at the same time, if desired.</para>

          <para><example>
              <title>Virtual host with context path configuration in
              *-rack.ymls</title>

              <para><screen>web:
  host: www.mycorp.com
  context: /app-one</screen></para>
            </example></para>
