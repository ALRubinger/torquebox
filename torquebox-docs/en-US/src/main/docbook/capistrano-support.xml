  <title>Capistrano Support</title>

    <title>Capistrano</title>

    <para>Capistrano is a deployment tool to assist in moving code from a
    repository to a production server.</para>

    <title>App-Server separate from App</title>

    <para>The TorqueBox server in production is a separate entity from the
    applications being deployed upon it. When deploying with mongrel or other
    traditional Ruby solutions, part of the deployment normally includes
    restarting the server. TorqueBox does not need to be restarted nearly as
    often.</para>

    <para>Generally the TorqueBox server is installed in a system-wide
    location since it may support multiple applications simultaneously. For
    install, you may simply unpackage and install it under
    <filename>/opt/torquebox-server</filename>.</para>

    <para>The TorqueBox server can be managed through a normal
    <filename>init.d/</filename> script, or through Daniel Bernstein's
    <command>daemontools</command>. The Capistrano support provided by
    TorqueBox can work with either process for manaing the server, when
    necessary.</para>

    <para>Either way, two settings in the your application's deploy.rb are
    required to be able to deploy to a remove TorqueBox server.</para>

    <para><screen>set :jboss_home,       "/opt/torquebox-server/jboss"
set :jboss_config,     :default</screen>These should point to the same
    location as <envar>$JBOSS_HOME</envar> on the server. The
    <varname>:jboss_config</varname> matches the <envar>$JBOSS_CONF</envar>,
    and is only required if a configuration other than default is
    desired.</para>

    <para><note>
        <para>Capistrano support is still evolving and will be fully
        documented once it settles.</para>
