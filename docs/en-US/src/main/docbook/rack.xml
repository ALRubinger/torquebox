  <title>Rack Support</title>

  <para>Rack is a specification which describes how web server engines can
  integrate with additional logic written in Ruby. Rack is a akin to CGI or
  the Java Servlets Spec in terms of goals and functionality.</para>

  <para>TorqueBox current supports general
  <filename>config.ru</filename>-based applications. In your application's
  directory, your Rack application can be booted from a file named
  <filename>config.ru</filename> that you provide. The Ruby runtime provided
  to your application is quite rudimentary. If you desire to use RubyGems or
  other libraries, it is up to you to require the necessary files (for
  instance, <code>require 'rubygems'</code>).</para>
