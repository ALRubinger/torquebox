  <title>What is TorqueBox?</title>

  <para>TorqueBox provides an enterprise-grade environment that not only
  provides complete Ruby-on-Rails compatibility, but also goes beyond the
  functionality offered in traditional Rails environments.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Built upon JBoss AS</title>

    <para>Instead of building a Ruby Application Platform from the ground-up,
    TorqueBox leverages the existing ninja-grade functionality JBoss has been
    shipping for years in the JBoss Application Server. JBoss AS includes
    high-performance clustering, caching and messaging functionality. By
    building Ruby capabilities on top of this foundation, your Ruby
    applications gain more capabilities right out-of-the-box.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Built upon JRuby</title>

    <para>JRuby is a fast, compliant implementation of the Ruby language upon
    the Java Virtual Machine. Pure Ruby applications run un-modified within
    the JRuby interpreter. By binding JRuby to the components within JBoss,
    their functionality is exposed in a manner suitable to Rubyists.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Open-Source</title>

    <para>TorqueBox is a product of the JBoss Community, and is completely
    open-source software. TorqueBox is licensed under the LGPL. You may
    download the binaries or the source-code, modify it if you desire, and use
    it, even for profit, without any licensing costs.</para>
