  <title>Ruby Runtime Pooling</title>

  <section>
    <title>Control thread concurrency using
    <filename>pooling.yml</filename></title>

    <para>Since the TorqueBox platform supports Rails 2.2+, which are
    threadsafe, the default mode of operation is to share a single Ruby
    runtime across threads.</para>

    <para>If your application is not designed to be threadsafe, you can
    instead pool the runtimes allowing a single-theaded model. Typically, if
    your application creates and uses global variables to manage state for a
    single request, you may have problems with the default multithreaded
    behavior.</para>

    <para>To enable pooling-mode instead of shared multithreading you need to
    add a YAML file at
    <filename><envar>$RAILS_ROOT</envar>/config/pooling.yml</filename>. This
    file is optional, and only required if you wish to enable pooling.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Pooling for web requests</title>

      <para>A section named web defines the pooling configuration for all
      regular web requests. This does not include SOAP endpoints. SIP requests
      do participate in the web pool, though.</para>

      <para>Web pooling is defined by creating a section named
      <classname>web</classname>, and specifying <parameter>min</parameter>
      and <parameter>max</parameter> parameters for the pool. The minimum
      number of runtimes will be created before your application starts. As
      the available items in the pool are exhausted, new ones will be
      asynchronously created, up to the maximum specified.</para>

      <para>Currently there is no reaping performed on the pool reduce its
      size.</para>
